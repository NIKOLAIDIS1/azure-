# Project Description: Azure IoT Edge End-to-End Telemetry Filtering and Storage

## Objective
The goal of the project was to deploy an Azure IoT Edge device, simulate telemetry data, filter it based on specific temperature thresholds, and store the filtered data securely in Azure Blob Storage for future analysis.

---

## Architecture Overview

1. **IoT Edge Device (Linux - Zorin OS 17.3)**
   - Installed and configured **Azure IoT Edge runtime (aziot-edged)** on a Linux machine.
   - Deployed the **Simulated Temperature Sensor** module (`tempSensor`) to generate telemetry data (temperature, pressure, humidity).
   
2. **Azure IoT Hub**
   - Device (`NIKOLAIDIS_4`) registered and connected to IoT Hub.
   - Device telemetry was streamed live to IoT Hub.
   
3. **Azure Stream Analytics Job**
   - Created a Stream Analytics job to read incoming telemetry from IoT Hub.
   - Applied a **SQL-like query** to filter events where:
     ```sql
     machine.temperature > 27
     ```
   - Only events with `machine.temperature` above 27Â°C were selected for output.

4. **Azure Blob Storage (Storage Account: kubas)**
   - Configured Azure Storage as the output sink for Stream Analytics.
   - Filtered events were written into a container named **high-temperature-events**.
   - Files were organized by:
     ```
     date=YYYY-MM-DD/hour=HH/minute=MM/part-xxxxx.json
     ```



- **Verification:**  
  - Verified live telemetry from the device using `az iot hub monitor-events`.
  - Confirmed filtered events arriving into Azure Blob Storage.

## Final Results

âœ… IoT Edge device running and sending telemetry  
âœ… Stream Analytics filtering events based on machine temperature > 27Â°C  
âœ… Filtered events stored in Azure Blob Storage structured by timestamp  
âœ… Full cloud-side telemetry filtering with no need for device reconfiguration
